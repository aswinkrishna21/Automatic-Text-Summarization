# Automatic Text Summarization

Currently, I am playing around with the data and looking at various known methods to summarize text. Will keep updating the repository frequently :)

UPD 3/9/20 : I came to know about a so called "pointer_generator" which helps in better implementation of the Seq2Seq model and I am on it currently.

## Model ##
* LSTM based Seq2Seq model for Abstractive Text Summarization
* Pointer mechanism for handling inaccuracies in summarization such as repeating words, OOV (Out of vocab) words
